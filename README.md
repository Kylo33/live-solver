# Live Solver

An app that generates a solution to a connected smart Rubik's cube in real time â€” saving valuable time during misscrambles.

Misscrambles are inconvenient. This app is built with [React](https://react.dev/) and is a proof of concept for other apps like algorithm trainers and speedsolving timers.
